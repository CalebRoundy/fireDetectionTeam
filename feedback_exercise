Peer Feedback: (Christopher Jones, Grace Siu,
Consider looking into the R package spBayes and see if their is an implementation in python 
  - this is a good package for created models for point referenced spatial data.
Consider looking at other data that may be available for the same landscape such as humidity, rain and vegetation

How we will address this feedback:
The spBayes package will be looked into a litter further to see if it would be an effective way to create a model for the data,
but currently there are many other methods to create models for this type of data that may be easier to implement and more 
convenient. However, this feedback will be taken into consideration and we will see if this package is easy to implement into python
and how effective it may be.

Quality of Feedback:
The feedback was helpful, but more in the sense that discussing the project helped solidify what our plan of action was going
forward. There were not really any issues raised by the other team that needed to be addressed, but they did provide helpful
comments and suggestions going forward.
